<p style="text-align: justify;"> Namaskar friends, This is Gopa Vasanth again came back to you with my different  experience Do you think about  tittle  is crazy  ha ha be cool I am going to share my First experience in cooking wow that's really  cool and  funny feeling during my semester  vacation by my mentor suggestion.<br><br> I went to cook in kitchen that was very strange to me In kitchen I did not found all the requirements for beginning, Actually that was my home from past 15 yrs I am living But still I don't know where all the ingredients were placed,  Slowly I came to find all items with my mom's help and also she shocked me seeing me in the kitchen ha ha  that is very exiting moment to cook for me and decided to prepare Gulabjam for the first time by me and by asking my mother<br><br> I came to know all the process and finally made it very difficultly wow I found great difficulty in mixing flour with water and preparing a round ball shaped wow that's  was really a great task that our parents were doing daily in home and we really don't know that cause, Well for the first time that was really funny and finally made it .Cooking is also not an easy thing that requires a lot of patience and also a talent and requires a lot of hand Magic to bring that item into a perfect taste and also requires good talent to mix all the ingredients in perfect measurements. Friends I also request you to try it and can share your experience with us Really we do find a very crazy moment in cooking and one should never miss that experience in a life.
