My name is Bhanu Prakash and YES! I am an Indian, in fact, proud to be an Indian. Out of curiosity, you might be having the question why be proud right? Well nice question everyone, there is a lot to say about me being a proud Indian. I may not have given any contribution to India until now but being a child of this country is itself a bliss. A nation's culture resides in the hearts and soul of its people.

One of the greatest praises someone gave about India
<blockquote><strong>"India was the motherland of our race and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages. India was the mother of our philosophy, of much of our mathematics, of the ideals embodied in Christianity... of self-government and democracy. In many ways, Mother India is the mother of us all."</strong>
<h4>- Will Durant, American Historian 1885-1981</h4>

<h3>Where is this country located?</h3>
<strong>India </strong>is the country that occupies the greater part of South Asia. It consists of 29 states, each with a control over its own affairs with 6 less fully empowered union territories.

<h3>India And Technology</h3>
Science, technology, and innovation have had a great impact on economic growth and social development in India. To start with scientific-technological advancements our Atomic Research Commission, set up in 1948, is engaged in valuable nuclear research for peaceful purposes. The successful launching of Polar Space Launching Vehicle was India’s entry into the league of the major space powers of the world. India’s space program rocketed to next level with the successful launch of the second Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.

In respect of religion in India, there is no end of its range. India is the place of the reunion of many religions and languages of the world.

In spite of the fact that there are numerous languages among various races, there is a sense of national unity and oneness among all the Indians. It is this spirit of patriotism that binds us together as one nation.

 
<h3>Love and Humanity</h3>
All the above mentioned things about India will make us proud for some time. We may .find many better inventions, technologies evolving better than India in different countries but there is something which all the other countries cannot give. There is something called as "LOVE" The best thing you can find is the inexplicable love and affection we Indians show towards everyone. People from all countries all welcome to India.

Not to forget we Indians never have attacked any country except for defending ourselves until now in the history of India.

And to go on say about India there are so many things namely Sports, Literature, Food and cuisine, Occupations, Art and Architecture, Bio-Diversity etc.

What is there in India not to love? Everyone and everything we see has some or the other inner meaning which Indians have imbibed.
