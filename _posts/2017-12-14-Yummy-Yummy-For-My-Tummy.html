<p style="text-align: justify;"> Namaskar friends, This is Gopa Vasanth ) again coming back to you with my different experience. 
  Do you think the tittle  is crazy?  haha be cool. I am going to share my First experience in cooking, wow! that's really  cool and
  funny. During my semester vacation with my mentor suggestion I came to cook.<br><br> Went I went into kitchen I felt very strange. 
  Actually I am living in that same home till many years but still I didn't found all the ingredients, Slowly I came to find one by one 
  with my mom's help and She was shocked by seeing me in the kitchen hahaha that is very exiting moment to cook and decided to prepare 
  Gulabjam for the first time <br><br> I came to know all the process and finally made it with great difficulties. 
  I found great difficulty in mixing flour with water and preparing a round ball shaped that's was really a great task that our parents 
  were doing daily in home and we really don't know that cause, Well for the first time that was really funny and finally made it. 
  Cooking is also not an easy thing that requires a lot of patience and also a talent and requires a lot of hand Magic to bring that 
  item into a perfect taste and also requires good talent to mix all the ingredients in perfect measurements. Friends I also request 
  you to try it and can share your experience with us, Really we do find a very crazy moment in cooking and one should never miss that 
  experience in a life.
