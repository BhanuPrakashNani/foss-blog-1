MATA AMRITANANDAMAYI known as our beloved AMMA, celebrated her 64th birthday with all her devotees.  I have only heard that Amma's birthday is celebrated very grandly, but after experiencing it I can undoubtedly say that its way more than that.

<strong>Birthday Preparations:</strong>

Getting into the celebrations , the week before the birthday was full of preparations. The major part of the preparations was constructing the Pandhal (Stage). Then the lightings were the next major part. The whole streets of Amritapuri were lightened by the lights and our hearts were enlightened by Amma's preaching. Stalls containing all varieties of food from all over India were arranged.

We the students were allocated duties in particular areas near the ashram and the college for three days. I was so happy to be the Student Seva Shift Co-coordinator, Shift Coordinator, and also the Group coordinator. My duty was to make sure that no one inside the Pandhal litters any garbage along with my group.

I personally enjoyed a lot during the seva, had a whole new experience and the best part is I loved it like anything. After the seva I have had crazy experiences with my friends. We played like kids till 4 in the morning, rolled down the gardens, and what not. Whatever I did I found it funny.

On the day of birthday, our honorable President Dr. Ram Nath Kovind gave a visit to our campus and had a formal talk with the students and devotees. It was a grateful experience to have our Indian President in our campus.

Also we had many programs conducted to entertain the devotees and the students too. The best performance was given by one of the greatest dancers of India - Shobana. I felt very lucky to spectate her dance.

Also many marriages were done under the supervision of AMMA on the day.

votees accommodation. This lead 8 members to get into one room . I made many more new friends and got to know about many people. Everyday fights for getting into the bathrooms and our naughty mischiefs were the best part of that stay in the hostel for those four days. I covered almost all the stalls during the celebrations and the best stall I found out to be was the Ice - cream stall. I have got many new memories with my friends.

I am feeling very happy to be a part of Amma's Birthday celebrations. Waiting for next year to enjoy a lot more. Its my great pleasure to being blessed by Amma.
